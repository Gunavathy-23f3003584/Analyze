# Data Analysis and Automation Workflow

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://github.com/Gunavathy-23f3003584/Analyze/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Project Description

This project establishes a comprehensive and automated workflow for data analysis. It focuses on processing structured data, ensuring code quality through linting, and automating the generation and publication of analytical results using GitHub Actions. The core objective is to demonstrate a robust, reproducible, and continuously integrated data processing pipeline, from initial data preparation to the deployment of insights.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Robust Data Processing**: Includes a corrected `execute.py` script designed for accurate data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Standardized Data Input**: Conversion of `data.xlsx` to `data.csv` ensures a consistent and easily consumable data format, simplifying downstream processing.
*   **Automated Code Quality**: Integration of `ruff` for linting ensures adherence to code standards and identifies potential issues early in the development cycle, promoting maintainable code.
*   **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)**: A GitHub Actions workflow automates the entire process from code commit to result publication.
*   **Dynamic Result Generation**: The `result.json` output is generated on-the-fly during CI and published via GitHub Pages, ensuring it always reflects the latest state of the codebase and data.
*   **Environment Control**: Explicitly configured for compatibility with Python 3.11+ and Pandas 2.3, ensuring a stable execution environment.
